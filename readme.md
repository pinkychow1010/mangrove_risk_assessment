# Mangrove Risk Assessment

### 03 May 2024

This projects aim to visualize mangrove data from Global Mangrove Watch between 2016 and 2020, as well as to assess their potential risk from sea level rise.
The folder contains a Jupyter notebook where the whole workflow is documented, a text file consisting the Earth Engine script for data inspection and download, and several figures from data visualization.
